This project demonstrates a practical implementation of a 5-Day Weather Forecast System with real-time data integration and basic data visualization, designed to simulate real-world software applications and machine learning pipeline integration. The code uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch both current and forecasted weather data for any city globally, offering a user-friendly and visually informative experience.

At its core, the system is powered by two endpoints: one for current weather and another for the 5-day/3-hour interval forecast. The user inputs the name of the city, which is appended into dynamic URLs that are structured using Python's string formatting to call the RESTful APIs. This ensures flexibility and reusability across different locations.

The requests library is used to handle all HTTP calls, and error handling is embedded to notify the user when the city name is incorrect or the API call fails. If the request is successful, the JSON data returned by the API is parsed to extract key weather metrics—temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather descriptions. The code then formats and displays this information in a clean and concise manner, mimicking real-time dashboard behavior.

For the 5-day forecast, the program collects date-time stamps and temperatures from each 3-hour interval. These values are stored in two lists: one for datetime objects (for accurate plotting) and the other for corresponding temperature readings. Using the matplotlib library, a line chart is plotted that displays temperature trends over the 5-day window. This enables users to visually understand how the temperature will change throughout the week.

What makes this project particularly interview-friendly is that it highlights multiple key software engineering skills:

API integration and RESTful services handling.
Error checking and user input validation.
JSON parsing and data manipulation.
Data visualization using matplotlib, including handling date-time formatting.
Real-world application of Python programming and software design.
Modular coding through functions for reusability and clarity.
Potential for further machine learning integration, such as training a model to predict weather based on historical trends.
Moreover, this system lays the foundation for more advanced forecasting applications by demonstrating a clear separation between data ingestion, processing, and visualization—core components of a typical data science or ML pipeline. By incorporating APIs, dynamic data rendering, and plotting, the project mirrors many of the responsibilities found in backend and full-stack development roles, making it a well-rounded and technically rich addition to any portfolio.
